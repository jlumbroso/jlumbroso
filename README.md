Faculty at Princeton University's Department of Computer Science. I love to teach, to mentor and advise students, to think "at scale", to build stuff open source, and to expand the circle of people who identify as "programmers."

### 🎲 Probabilistic Algorithms

- 🌊 Many data streaming probabilistic algorithms, including those I design and study, use **families of hash functions**. Hard to find families with good properties (simple, efficient, not too correlated). A affine transform of CRC32 hash, with factors drawn from Mersenne Twister provides a good empirical family. Details are tricky to get right—so I get them right for you!

  - _Python implementation at [`python-random-hash`](https://github.com/jlumbroso/python-random-hash) and available on PyPI; Java implementation available at [`java-random-hash`](https://github.com/jlumbroso/java-random-hash), on Maven Central and GitHub Packages._

- 🙆🏼 **Affirmative Sampling** (2022) with Conrado Martínez ([PDF](https://collaborate.princeton.edu/en/publications/affirmative-sampling-theory-and-applications)), is a novel probabilistic sampling algorithm of which the size of the sample grows as a function of the (unknown) number of distinct elements, making it uniquely adaptive to queries that depend on the relative proportion of elements. _Reference implemented in Python at [`affirmative-sampling`](https://github.com/jlumbroso/affirmative-sampling)_
